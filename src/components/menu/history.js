            <h4> THE ORIGIN AND MEANING OF IRU-EGBEDE </h4>
            <p> The name IRU much like the people, describes it , originated from Benin kingdom.
                Our forebearers were believed to be direct descendant of the prince Egbede. History 
                has it  that Egbede was one of the sons of Oba Esigie who reigned in 15th century. 
                Another great grandson of Esigie – Oba Ohuan. Who reigned in 1606 Ad. Died childless. 
             </p>
            <p>Following the death of of Oba Ohuan, the much coveted throne of the Benin kingdom 
                was left vacant. The succession the throne was thrown open to members of the royal
                family. It was during this period prince egbede made an unsuccessful  attempt to 
                succeed to the throne of his rival, Ahenzae was crown he Oba in 1641Ad. During his 
                reign Oba Ahenzae founded many villages including Iguehenzae. 
            </p>
            <p> The embittered Egbede migrated from Benin city in the interest of peace to settle at
                Uvbe subsequent threats from Oba Ahenzea following the death of Oro, daughter of Egbede
                and whom the Oba found favour , compared Egbede to further migrate east word. He finally 
                settled in place called Owa, east of Orhionmwon. 
            </p>
            <p> Prince egbede and his relations at Iguehenzae often exchanged visit. In one such  visits,
                 Egbede, apparently  disillusioned for not having a male child was calmed to have planted 
                 a cherry named after him. It was fondly referred to as Otien-Egbede (udara-Egbede) . this 
                 expression, apart from immortalizing his name, symbolizes the historical link with is kings men. 
            </p>
            <p> Later at Owa Egbede married and his wife gave birth to a baby boy, whom he named Iruna meaning
                “ I  have accomplished “. This was an expression of Egbede’s profound joy for begetting a male 
                child. The present day name Iru,  was abbreviated from Irune. 
            </p>
            <p> There after, Egbede  left Owa to benin on  his homeward journey. It was reported that he died
                 without reaching Benin city. After the death of Egbede, his son iru, founded a village which was
                  named after him. He married and had two sons called Isi and Oso from whom he descended  
                  meaning “ I  have accomplished “. This was an expression of Egbede’s profound joy for begetting 
                  a male child. The present day name Iru,  was abbreviated from Irune.
                </p>
            <p> During his life time, Iru and his children fostered the cordial relations with his paternal kings men at
                 Iguehenzae. There were known to be very loyal and indeed paid their tribute to the Oba of Benin. 
             </p>
            <p> Following the death of iru, the urge to return their kit and kin in Iguehenzae dawned on our fore fathers.
                 This urge was provoked by unpleasant circumstances caused by her neighbors. When the chanced moment struck,
                  pa  Ayetin led the mass exodus of iru people back to Iguehenzae in 1923. They were well received and 
                 by the people of Iguehenzae from where they finally moved to their present abode in 1924. 
            </p>
        <p>
            Ever since, the people of Iru have lived in peaceful cooperation’s with their neighbors. 
           Jointly signed by the under-mentioned name on the 5th of November  1988.
